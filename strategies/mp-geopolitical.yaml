  description: |
    MP Materials geopolitical resource play.
    Triggered by Trump Greenland invasion announcement.

    Thesis: US gains strategic rare earth mineral supply independence
    by controlling Greenland deposits. Reduces China dependency.
    Drives rare earth prices up, MP production/valuation skyrockets.

    Entry: Invasion announced + +8% gap up + supply implications clear
    Targets: +35-50% (supply dominance), +85-100% (China concerns)
    Duration: 60 days (medium-term thesis)

risk:
  maxRiskPerTrade: 1500   # High conviction = larger position
  maxHoldingDays: 60      # Hold longer for supply thesis

context:
  # IMPORTANT: This is a SUPPLY CHAIN play
  # Success depends on:
  # 1. Greenland invasion actually happens
  # 2. US begins rare earth extraction/contracts
  # 3. China retaliates (accelerates supply concerns)

  entry_prerequisites:
    - Trump announces Greenland annexation
    - Media discusses rare earth implications
    - Stock gaps up 8%+ on supply story
    - Volume spikes 2x+ average

  supply_catalysts:
    - Rare earth mining contracts announced (US/Greenland)
    - China tariffs on US tech (drives rare earth demand)
    - Semiconductor shortage news (rare earths critical)
    - Government rare earth stockpile announcements
    - EV battery demand surge (rare earths essential)

  why_mp_wins:
    - MP = US's primary rare earth producer
    - Currently 8-10% of US supply, rest from China
    - Greenland could triple US production capacity
    - Defense/tech will demand domestic supply
    - Valuation could 2-3x on supply security thesis

  exit_criteria:
    - Greenland deal cancelled/abandoned
    - China doesn't retaliate (supply concerns ease)
    - Rare earth prices collapse (supply increases elsewhere)
    - 60-day thesis window closes
    - Overbought exhaustion (RSI 85+)
