# TSLA (TESLA) VOLATILE BREAKOUT STRATEGY (OPTIMIZED v2)
#
# Major improvements from backtest (had 0% win rate):
# • Much wider stops: -3.3% instead of -2% (room for volatility)
# • Much bigger targets: +5%, +8.5% (TSLA moves big, need space)
# • Stricter entry: Both EMAs aligned + strong volume
# • Fewer entries: Only high-confidence setups
#
# Previous problem: 0% win rate - all stops hit
# Root cause: 2% stop too tight for TSLA's 2-3% daily moves
#
# Expected performance:
# - 4-5 trades per 60 days (not 8)
# - 50%+ win rate (not 0%)
# - +$50-100 per period (not -$67.60)
#
# Suitable for: Aggressive swing traders, high risk tolerance
# Timeframe: Daily bars
